# module-selector 
## Description
This was a group project me and 8 other KCL students did for the 5CCS2SEG module. James Toner, the client (from the Centre for Technology Enhanced Learning at KCL), gave us the task of writing this program which is a web application that allows students to search and track modules taught at King's College London with the aim to aid them in crafting a degree course that best fits their target criteria (career, skills learned, etc.).

The application is implemented using a variant of the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node) stack, utilizing MySQL as a replacement of MongoDB.

Below is a list of the team members that worked on this project and the roles they had:
* Dawan Abdulla: front-end web developer
